	<h1>Creativerse Sprites Picker</h1>
	<p style="font-weight: bolder; color: red">IMPORTANT: The sprites codes have been changed by R50, this picker will give you the right sprite in most cases BUT there still are some gotchas: first, some codes fail completely and also affect the surrounding / following sprites or text; second, some codes will not match until the developers release the current resource files to let me update this picker.</p>
	<p style="font-weight: bolder; color: red">So, find the sprite you want and see if it's one of the failing ones, otherwise try it in the game and see if the code is still valid, and as a last resort head to <a href="sprites.html" target="_blank">this page</a> and patiently test out the ranges until you find the sprite you need (assuming that sprite is still there... who knows).</p>
	<p>This tool lets you pick up sprite codes to be put into Arc Signs in the game <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/280790" target="_blank">Creativerse</a>, free to play on Steam.</p>

	<p>Click on any icon to have its code appended to the yellow textarea below, then copy those codes into the Arc Signs and alter them as you please (in particular you can change their size by prepending &lt;size=2&gt; to those codes, the default size is 1 and you can make them really large, just play with the values, <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/280790/discussions/0/1479856439030191185/" target="_blank">more info about Arc Sign codes</a>).</p>
