	<h1>Creativerse Sprites Picker</h1>
	<p style="font-weight: bolder; color: #900">THE SPRITES HERE SHOULD ALL WORK FINE NOW ... BUT: since the sprites codes have been changed by R50 and I've not been provided with the actual resource files that are being used by the game, I've had to screenshot the sprites myself. That's why they're all blurred and badly aligned. They should work fine in the game, though. [update: now I have access to the resource files but there are still issues with failing codes, for that reason I'm keeping the picker as it is until we get news from the developers]</p>
	<p style="font-weight: bolder; color: #900">As far as I can tell, some sprites are currently missing (they don't appear here and they don't work in the game).</p>
	<p>This tool lets you pick up sprite codes to be put into Arc Signs in the game <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/280790" target="_blank">Creativerse</a>, free to play on Steam.</p>

	<p>Click on any icon to have its code appended to the yellow textarea below, then copy those codes into the Arc Signs and alter them as you please (in particular you can change their size by prepending &lt;size=2&gt; to those codes, the default size is 1 and you can make them really large, just play with the values, <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/app/280790/discussions/0/1479856439030191185/" target="_blank">more info about Arc Sign codes</a>).</p>

	<p>Only tested in Chrome, may work in other browsers.</p>
	<p style="font-weight: bolder; color: #900">This picker used to show some manually edited names for the unknown sprites. It's not like this anymore: the ones that lack a visible, in-game name are now marked by their internal name.</p>
	<p><button id="switch">Switch to List View</button> Filter: <input type="text" id="filter" placeholder="type here to filter icons"> <small>(type just "?" to see items with a missing visible name)</small></p>
	<p><label><input type="checkbox" id="outputname">Output sprite names too</label></p>
